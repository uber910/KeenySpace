# Backup and Restore

The #1 self-host failure mode for KeenySpace is a split backup: copying the markdown
files but not the database, or vice versa. State lives in TWO places that must stay
consistent:

- **Filesystem canon** (`keenyspace-fs` volume): the actual markdown workspaces — pages,
  WAL logs, blueprints.
- **Postgres rows** (`postgres-data` volume): the workspace registry, users, API keys
  (hashed), audit log, and compile cursors.

`keenyspace backup` captures both in a single tarball, atomically, through the server.
Always use it instead of hand-copying volumes.

Note: the Authentik database (`authentik-postgresql` volume — users, groups, providers)
is NOT part of the KeenySpace backup. Snapshot it separately if you manage users you
cannot trivially recreate. The OIDC application itself is re-provisioned from the
blueprint on every boot and needs no backup.

## Backup procedure

**Step 1: Enable the admin API.** The backup endpoint (`POST /v1/admin/backup`) is only
mounted when `KEENYSPACE_ADMIN_API_ENABLED=1` is set in the server environment —
without it the CLI gets a 404. Add the flag to `deploy/.env` (the compose file injects
it via `env_file`) and restart the server:

```bash
echo 'KEENYSPACE_ADMIN_API_ENABLED=1' >> deploy/.env
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d keenyspace
```

**Step 2: Run the backup** (requires a logged-in CLI session or an API key):

```bash
keenyspace backup --output keenyspace-backup.tar.gz
```

The CLI streams the gzipped tarball from the server with a progress bar. Without
`--output` it writes `keenyspace-backup-<iso-timestamp>.tar.gz` in the current
directory.

**Step 3: Store the tarball off-host.** A backup on the same disk as the stack protects
against nothing. Ship it to object storage, another machine, or at minimum another
volume.

**Step 4: Disable the admin API again** (see the security note below):

```bash
sed -i '' '/KEENYSPACE_ADMIN_API_ENABLED/d' deploy/.env   # macOS; drop the '' on Linux
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d keenyspace
```

## Restore procedure

With the admin API enabled (Step 1 above) and an empty or expendable target:

```bash
keenyspace restore keenyspace-backup.tar.gz
```

The server validates the archive before applying it:

- **Version/schema mismatch** returns 422 and the CLI exits with code 6. Restore into a
  server version compatible with the one that produced the backup (same or newer minor —
  Alembic migrates restored state forward on next boot).
- **Non-empty target** returns 409. If you really intend to overwrite, re-run with
  `--force` — this wipes existing data and is irreversible.

After a successful restore:

1. `keenyspace login` — sessions are not part of the backup; re-authenticate.
2. `keenyspace workspace list` — confirm your workspaces are back.
3. `keenyspace workspace pull <slug>` — re-sync local vaults from the restored canon.

## The drill

`deploy/scripts/backup-restore-drill.sh` rehearses the full cycle automatically:
bring the stack up, back up to the local filesystem, destroy everything
(`docker compose down -v`), bring the stack back up, restore, and assert that
workspaces survived.

**WARNING: the drill runs `docker compose down -v`, which destroys the named volumes —
including `keenyspace-fs` with your real workspace data. NEVER run it against a live
deployment.** Use a throwaway compose project so its volumes are isolated from yours:

```bash
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=ks-drill bash deploy/scripts/backup-restore-drill.sh
```

The script enables `KEENYSPACE_ADMIN_API_ENABLED=1` for its own run and downloads the
tarball to the host filesystem BEFORE wiping the volumes (a tarball left inside a
container or volume would be destroyed along with it). Expected final output:

```
Backup-restore drill PASSED - 1 workspace(s) intact
```

(The workspace count reflects whatever was seeded before the backup.) The same script
runs in CI as a release gate, so a release cannot ship with a broken backup/restore
path.

## Security note

Keep `KEENYSPACE_ADMIN_API_ENABLED` OFF in normal production operation. The flag is
per-operation: enable it for a backup or restore, then remove it and restart. The
admin endpoints stream your entire dataset to any authenticated caller — there is no
reason to leave that surface mounted between backups.
